> Think of growing a company as building construction. Then, all endeavors should direct to making this building a solid foundation. First, you need to recognize whatever is not holding firm and true. Second, you have to replace it with something higher and stronger. Steps apply to each block, brick by brick, over again, until something solid and good has been built.

I find crafting this animation quite fun. The special flavor comes from English pronunciation. A native English speaker [will do voice over](https://youtu.be/4cZqKZJ_v24) at the end. This is just crafting story, work in progress, a draft. Now, let's move to the point where we apply the growing wisdom.

Zeko.Me started out by building Linux distribution from scratch. The idea was to create more suitable Linux for shipping turnkey solutions from other vendors. Everyone could have just his own, tailor-made, underlying Linux platform. Over the past year we shifted more of our attention on building customized systems. Also, this model turns out to be a better source of funding.

We must always see all things as they are. To continue pursue full-force, there is a need to shelve Zeko.Me's Linux distribution for the time being. It hurts a little bit, but there is a bigger excitement for things to come.

Zeko.Me's online space has been purged from everything. Such action is a necessity due to misalignment with where Zeko.Me is going from now on.

What happens next will be part of work-in-progress, covered here, on this blog.
