Introduction of the new IFRS9 standards increase the necessity for quantification of macroeconomic environment effects on the bank portfolio, modeling standardization and automation. One of IFRS9 requirements refers to the expected credit loss forward-looking modeling, where each calibrated parameter should take into account any future market and macroeconomic environment changes - internal and external effects.

Our new software product JFloret™ Macro Modeler is an ideal solution for quantification of effects of different indicators on the bank portfolio. It’s user friendly and covers wide spectrum of application - IFRS9, stress testing, ICAAP, collateral re-evaluation etc.

Indicators are given as independent variables, and they are not limited only to available macroeconomic indicators. The portfolio development is measured by probability of default, loss rate, loan to value ratio, which are given as dependent variables. The software efficiently provides quantification of effects of selected indicators supported by machine learning algorithms.

A user is not required to be an expert in field of econometric modeling. The software implementation includes different modeling methodologies and allows testing of multiple modeling scenarios. The number of simulations is unlimited, and every successful simulation is saved, which allows comparison of different modeling approaches.
